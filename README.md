## Welcome

All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub — and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: When and how to request a review; how to provide a review of someone else's pull request.
- **What you'll build**: We'll be reviewing a pull request for a simple game.
- **Prerequisites**: We assume you are familiar with creating branches, commits, and pull requests—you can learn this in our [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Open a pull request
2. Assign yourself
3. Leave a review
4. Suggest changes
5. Apply changes
6. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'review-pull-requests',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-review-pull-requests',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
