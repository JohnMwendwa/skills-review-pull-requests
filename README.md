As you continue working on GitHub, remember that high quality reviews improve your projects. If you are new to a repository, inquire about what review practices they have so you can hit the ground running.

Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- You learned how to assign pull requests for review.
- You left a review on a pull request.
- You suggested changes to a pull request.
- You applied suggested changes to a pull request.

### What's next?

- Try adding a [`CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file to your project to automatically assign reviewers to pull requests.
- We'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/skills/discussions/categories/review-pull-requests).
