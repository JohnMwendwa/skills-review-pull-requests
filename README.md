## Step 2: Assign yourself

_Great job opening that pull request! :wave:_

**What is a _pull request review_?**: Reviewing a pull request is an opportunity to examine another contributor's changes and give them feedback. It's an awesome opportunity to learn more about how the project works and how others solve problems.

The best way to get a review is to ask for one. On GitHub, you can ask someone to review a pull request by assigning them as a reviewer or assignee. If you are not ready for review, consider [creating a draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) instead.

### :keyboard: Activity: Assign yourself

1. Open the pull request you just created.
1. Under **Assignees** on the right side of the screen, add yourself.

   Because you created the pull request, you can't assign yourself as a reviewer, but feel free to assign a friend as a reviewer instead to see how it works :smile:

1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
