## Step 1: Open a pull request

_Welcome to "Review pull requests"! :wave:_

Let's get started by opening a pull request.

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab in your repository.
2. Click **New pull request**.
3. In the **base:** dropdown, make sure **main** is selected.
4. Select the **compare:** dropdown, and click `update-game`.
5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Enter a title for your pull request: `Update the game over message`.
7. Enter a description for your pull request: `Update the game over message so people know how to play again!`
8. Click **Create pull request**.
9. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
